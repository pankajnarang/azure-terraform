# azure-terraform
To hold azure infra (IAC)

`Terraform providers are a kind of wrappers which help us to generate infra like azurerm, available on Terraform registry`

`To prevent automatic upgrade to new major versions, that may contain breaking changes, terraform recommends adding version constraints in required_providers block` 

```hcl
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.0.2"
    }
```
